                    <p>With the benefits of Bonsai plants, there are also some disadvantages that come along the way.
                        The main demerit of you buying a bonsai tree can be that these kinds of plants require excessive 
                        time, investment and dedication for it to survive. You need to make sure you water the plants in
                        a certain time every day, check whether there are any signs of mold on the plant. These plants 
                        need constant care and attention for it to nurture. They cannot be left for multiple days without
                        you taking care of it. These plants can also have been linked with increased insect 
                        infestations i.e., invasion of insects in the plant.
